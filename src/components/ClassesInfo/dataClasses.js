The main difference between Pilates and other areas of training is the preservation of the natural curves of the spine during exercises (with the exception of the initial stages of preparation). Classes are held at a calm pace, and exercises smoothly change from one to another and gradually become more complex. Due to this, all muscle groups work evenly, which is the main advantage of such training. Muscle fatigue will be slightly different compared to other areas of training - deeper, but less severe. The uniform should not restrict movement or cause discomfort. It is recommended to exercise in leggings, a sports top or a tight-fitting elastic T-shirt. For better stabilization with the carpet surface, it is also recommended to practice barefoot or wearing special socks with a grippy coating."

They are responsible for the formation of the muscle corset. SPINE: When exercising on TRX, axial load on the spine is eliminated due to the fact that the body is almost always in a suspended state. This eliminates the possibility of back injury. HEART: Like any physical exercise, training on TRX is beneficial for the cardiovascular system and strengthens it. WEIGHT LOSS: Training on TRX actively burns calories and also gives a powerful metabolic response - energy continues to be consumed for several hours after the end of the session. "
